    Hangoutville is a platform to connect directly with other people in your city.
  </p>
  <div class="title">How it works</div>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a post in your city introducing yourself</li>
    <li>People reply directly to your inbox</li>
    <li>Respond to replies or discard them</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="title">Why this platform?</div>
  <p>
    Hangoutville solves the problem of not knowing much about people in our city.  We can get to know people in a casual manner, without consuming lots of our time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Often, we are surrounded by 1,000s (if not 1,000,000s!) of people, yet with no quick introduction to them, we'll never know if we want to meet them or not.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hangoutville solves that by letting people briefly introduce themselves to their city.
  </p>
  <div class="title">How can I use Hangoutsville?</div>
  <p>
    Here are some examples to get your mind kickin':
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Find a piano teacher</li>
    <li>Offer to teach guitar</li>
    <li>Find collaborators for a project</li>
    <li>And of course, make friends!</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="title">üëè Have fun!</div>
  <p>
    What was that thing that you wanted to do again? Oh right... <i><u (click)="doItNow()">DO IT NOW!</u></i> while you're still alive and well!
